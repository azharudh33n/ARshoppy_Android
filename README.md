<h1> Introduction </h1>
ARShoppy aims to use the technology of
Augmented Reality (AR) to make E-commerce more interactive, approachable and the most
preferred shopping solution. It is an innovative AR shopping application that provides the user
with the feel of in-store shopping at home, liberating customers from the confusions that usually
occur in E-commerce sites. Customers can get a live 3-Dimensional (3D) preview of the products
augmented with the real-world environment by a simple touch. Incorporating AR into online
shopping not only saves userâ€™s time and money, but also provides them with a real-time simulation
of products brought to them in the comforts of their living space and this marks the beginning of
new era.
